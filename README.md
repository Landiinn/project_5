This is my ongoing project.

As you can see, I started too late to able to acomplish anything. 

As previously mentioned, I have been put in a bad circle. I had bad luck at the start, causing me to fall behind with the lessons.

This reults in all projects failing. So my hope is to send in this to give you a idea of what I want to be able to do.

I will book a call for resubmission, and as of now, I think I am in the right path, since my first resubmission will be my Java project, causing me to "start over" from the start. Do it over and do it right. 

I will accept my failed grade, and I will return a project, capable of passing next submission date.
